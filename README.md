Open Source Flow Cytometry Nodes for KNIME.


### Installation
Still in early alpha, do not use in production. Nodes will change drastically and without notice! If you insist on giving it a try and don't want to build it yourself, [contact me](mailto: aaron dot hart at gmail dot com).

### Useage 
See the [wiki](https://github.com/AaronNHart/Inflor/wiki)!
